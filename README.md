Word clouds (also known as text clouds or tag clouds) work in a simple way: the more a specific word appears in a source of textual data (such as a speech, blog post, or database), the bigger and bolder it appears in the word cloud.


Luckily, a Python package already exists in Python for generating word clouds. The package, called word cloud was developed by Andreas Mueller. Andreas Muller is an Associate Research Scientist at the Data Science Institute at Columbia University and author of the O'Reilly book "Introduction to machine learning with Python", describing a practical approach to machine learning with python and scikit-learn.

This project has a python file that selects at radom from secen (7) pre-defined images and creates a word cloud based upon the image and the inputs provided by the user.
